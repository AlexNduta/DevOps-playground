# Once lazy always lazy ~ Anonymous

- The repo contains the most recurring activities automated by bash scripts
## 1. magneto_script.sh:
pulls files from a remote server to the local machine, sefuk for backups.
just add paths to the config files or directories you want to make backups of in the array, pass the IP of your remote server as the first argument vector, get a cup of coffee, sit back and enjoy being lazy.

## 2. pull-scp
- this is the alpha version of the `magneto_script.sh` does not do much

## 3. pull-scp:
- This is the laziest script you will ever use to login to any remote sever using ssh, just map the path to your private key and run it.
